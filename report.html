    <h3>What is your site about? What is the essential story it tells? </h3>
    <br>
    <p>My website is a guide for the different parts of a synthesizer.
        I tried to keep it as simple as possible so that people with no prior knowledge can maybe
        understand something about sound designing on a synthesizer by the end of it.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Who are your audience? Are there relevant stakeholders? </h3>
    <br>
    <p>I created this with a number of people in mind. </p>
    <ol>
        <li>People who already have a knowledge of music, but don’t understand electronic music production.</li>
        <li>People with an interest in electronic music because of the weird and wacky sounds synthesisers can achieve.</li>
        <li>Young teenagers during a music class.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p>There is a large synthesizer enthusiast community online. Perhaps some enthusiasts might share this with their friends to spread the joy of synthesizers.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Give (at least) 3 examples that inspired you when creating your website. These could be websites, guest speakers, artists, books, etc. </h3>
    <br>
    <p>I was mainly inspired by the synthesisers that I own and the many many hours I have spent playing them. 
        I based the color pallet of the website on a synthesizer called the “Juno 6” by a Japanese company called 
        “Roland”. This is a classic synthesizer that came out in the 80s. My inspiration also comes from all the 
        artists I listen to such as Depeche Mode, OMD, Bjork, Tears For Fears that made me love these machines so much. 
        I also found it interesting that we can achieve basic sound synthesis on the web. I still remember when HTML 5 
        came out and things like drum machines where appearing on the web (link below to an example).

    <h3>What type of structure did you choose to implement? </h3>
    <p>I implemented	a very simple structure which consists of a navigation bar which is a flex box,
        and the main content which is a grid divided into two columns. One column for all the text and information,
        and the other with a visual interactive element. This very basic structure made it easy when making the pages
        responsive for multiple devices.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Give (at least) 3 ways in which you have ensured accessibility for your website. If you have used a WCAG tool, or evaluated it manually, give the results of that evaluation. </h3>
    <p>I regrettably didn’t spend too much time on accessibility. I provided ":focus" tags for buttons and “alt=“ attributes
        for images, but neglected sliders I have on certain pages. I used Firefox accessibility tools and it provided
        this message, “Interactive elements must be able to be activated using a keyboard”. This is something I did not
        implement because I could’t figure out how to on time. It is something I intend on implementing however. Sliders
        also do not have any focus styling or tab index styling.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Give 3 ways in which you have considered usability on your site. </h3>
    <br>
    <p>For all the interactive elements on my website, I’ve provided clear instructions on what they do.
        I made the website responsive so that it can be used on tablets and smart phones.
        I’ve tried my best at keeping the layout and walk through clean and simple.
        After I built my website I had my sister (who has no knowledge of synthesisers) test run it.
        She didn’t seem to have any issues navigating the website or understanding the content.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>State 3 things that you had to learn or research when creating the website. How did you find them out? From where? Did you take the examples directly, or did you modify them? </h3>
    <br>
    <p>I learned how to implement responsive design (not something I did on the group course work). I used the Mozilla MDN resources for this.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I learned how to have multiple instances of a canvas for my home page using p5.js library. It took a while to
        figure out because p5.js does not allow multiple canvases on the same page unless using p5.js on a certain mode
        appropriately named “instance mode”. I modified code they provide in their documentation for this.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>I learned a lot about web audio through the p5.js.sound library as well as Mozilla MDN. I intend to program
        something using the Web MIDI API which is well documented on Mozilla MDN.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>I learned about JS timeout functions.</p>
    <br>
    <p>A smaller thing I learned but genuinely took me 30 minutes to figure out. How Adobe’s curved line tool works.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>What resources does your work use? What libraries, plugins, are included? </h3>
    <p>As mentioned before, I used the p5.js and p5.sound.js libraries. I used FireFox a lot for styling and debugging
        JS logic. I also used adobe XD for designing the wire frame. I also used adobe XD to make the logo and the only
        image my website has. I used ProTools and one of my synthesizers to record a small melody featured on the page
        titled “effects.html”. The IDE I used is JetBrains IntelliJ.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>State 3 things that you think worked particularly well in your work.</h3>
    <br>
    <p>I am really please with all the interactive elements. I think they really aid in the understanding of the basics in sound synthesis.
        Event though the color scheme and design of the website is very minimalist, I find it aesthetically appealing.
        I’m pleased with the home page. I think it immediately gives the user a lot to look at and feel intrigued.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>State 3 things that you think might be improved. How would you do them differently another time? How would you fix them given more time now? </h3>
    <br>
    <p>Like I mentioned before, I couldn’t get my sliders to have the appropriate accessibility properties.
        I simply ran out of time here. I need to spend more time in the Mozilla MDN documentation and work through
        why my logic wasn’t working.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>On every page I provide a warning to the user that potentially loud audio is to be played. I would do this
        differently. Having a volume slider is a better solution to this, and providing a pop up warning when the user
        tries to play audio for the first time.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Looking at my CSS in the end I’ve come to realise the I have a lot of unnecessary class styling. I could
        definitely clean this up and in future be more aware of the different inheritances happening on elements.
    </p>
