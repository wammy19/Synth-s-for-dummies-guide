                        <br>
                        <p>Synthesisers don’t commonly come with effects built in, but more modern synthesizers are
                            being designed with effects included. Some common effects a synthesisers might have built
                            in are different types of delays, reverbs, and choruses. All these effects do different
                            things to the sound. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Reverb (short for reverberation) creates the sense of space to a sound.
                            Delay gives an ‘echoey’ effect, and chorus gives a ‘doubling’ or ‘unison’ type of effect.
                            Below are some sliders for a delay effect. The trigger button is hooked up to a triangle
                            wave with a very fast attack time, and a very short release time so that you can hear the
                            delay effect take place. Have a play around and compare the sound with the delay on, and
                            the delay off.</p>

                        <p>Effects are a nice way of colouring the sound. In production scenarios they are often
                            added into a song after everything has been recorded. There are many more variations of the
                            effects mentioned on this page as well as different types of other effects</p>
