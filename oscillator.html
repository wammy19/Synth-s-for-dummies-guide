                        <p>Depending on the synthesiser, oscillators might be found under the name  “DCO”, “VCO”, “Osc”
                            or more directly, “Oscillator”.  For the time being you don’t need to concern yourself with what
                            “DCO” or “VCO” mean, or the differences between the two. Oscillators are a crucial part
                            to a synthesiser as they generate waveforms which make an audible pitched sound.
                            Oscillators are usually able to generate different types of waveforms for timbral
                            difference. The most common waveforms one might find on a synthesiser are sine, square
                            (also know as pulse), triangle, and sawtooth waves. These waveforms all have their own
                            distinct sound.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Below are visual illustrations of what these waveforms look like when drawn,

                            Have a click on the illustrations to trigger a short sample of what each waveform sounds like.
                            Below the illustrations are also some sliders, have a play around with them and take notice
                            of how they effect the sound.</p>

                        <p>
                            PWM stands for ‘Pulse Width Modulation’. It is also often found under the name ‘Shape’ depending
                            on the synthesiser. PWM only affects the square wave. Try triggering a square wave
                            and have a play around with the ‘PWD’ slider (make sure the ‘LFO Amount’ slider is all the way to the left).
                            Also take notice of the oscilloscope.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Did you notice how it narrows or widens the square wave depending on how you are setting the slider? This change in width
                            gives the square wave a different timbre. The more narrow the square is, the more ‘nasal’ or
                            ‘thin’ sounding the waveform is. While the wider the square is, the more ‘fuller’ or ‘fat’
                            sounding the waveform is. This parameter can be set accordingly for the type of sound one is
                            trying to achieve when sound designing.

                        <h2>LFO (Low Frequency Oscillator).</h2>
                        <br>
                        <p>Presuming you have had a play around with the ‘LFO Amount’, and the ‘LFO Speed’ sliders
                            above. You might have noticed that these sliders are making the pitch of the selected
                            waveform go between getting higher, and then lower again. This is called modulation.
                            In this example we can say that the LFO is modulating the ‘Pitch’ parameter (slider).
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>To help understand what this means, try doing the following:</p>
                        <br>
                        <div class="lfoInstructions">
                            <ol>
                                <li>Position the ‘LFO Amount’ Slider all the way to the left.</li>
                                <li>Trigger a waveform of choice.</li>
                                <li>Drag the ‘Pitch’ slider left to right repeatedly.</li>
                                <li>Once the waveform has stopped. Set the ‘LFO Amount’ and ‘LFO Speed’ to roughly the middle.</li>
                                <li>Trigger a waveform of choice.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        <p>What do you notice? You can imagine that the LFO is moving the ‘Pitch’ slider without
                            you having to do it manually. </p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>So what are LFO’s exactly?</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>LFO stands for ‘Low Frequency Oscillator'. Like the name suggests. LFO’s  generate wave forms
                            that are pitched low, so low that they are inaudible. They can be used to shape the sound
                            in various ways. In the example we have here, the LFO is routed to the ‘Pitch’ slider. But
                            LFO’s can be routed to other parameters of a synthesiser.  The choice of parameters an LFO
                            can be routed to varies from synthesiser to synthesiser.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>LFO’s can also be different
                            waveforms. In the current example the LFO waveform is a sine wave, this gives a smooth
                            “sweeping” modulation. If the LFO was set to a square wave. The pitch would change between
                            two frequencies (notes) without the smooth “sweeping” of frequencies the sine wave is
                            giving us now. It is also possible to have more than one LFO on a synthesiser, this means
                            modulation of multiple parameters is possible. The ‘LFO Amount’ determines how intense the
                            modulation of the routed parameter is to be. While the ‘LFO Speed’ determines how fast or
                            slow the parameter is to be modulated.</p>
